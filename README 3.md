Task 3 = Writing Basic SELECT Queries

This task is about learning how to write basic SQL queries to extract and view data from one or more tables. You will use the SELECT statement to choose columns, apply conditions with WHERE (including AND, OR, LIKE, BETWEEN), arrange the results with ORDER BY, and restrict the number of rows using LIMIT. The final output will be an SQL script that shows different examples of these commands, helping you understand how to query and filter data effectively.

1. Retrieve data – use SELECT * for all columns or choose specific columns.

2. Filter results – use WHERE with conditions like AND, OR, LIKE, BETWEEN.

3. Sort data – use ORDER BY to arrange results in ascending or descending order.

4. Limit rows – use LIMIT to show only a certain number of results.
